## What Is a System Design Interview?

A system design interview evaluates your ability to design scalable, reliable, and efficient systems that solve real-world problems. Unlike coding interviews that test algorithm skills, system design interviews assess your architectural thinking and engineering judgment.

## Why This Matters

System design interviews are critical for senior roles because they:

- Demonstrate your ability to make technical decisions with business impact
- Show how you handle ambiguity and requirements gathering
- Reveal your communication skills when discussing complex technical topics
- Highlight your experience with large-scale, distributed systems

## The 5-Step Interview Framework

### 1. Clarify Requirements (2-3 minutes)

- **Ask probing questions** to understand scope and constraints
- **Identify users** and their primary use cases
- **Establish scale** (users, traffic, data volume)
- **Define functional and non-functional requirements**

### 2. High-Level Design (5-10 minutes)

- **Sketch core components** (clients, servers, databases, caches)
- **Define API contracts** between components
- **Outline data models** and relationships
- **Create a basic system flow** for primary use cases

### 3. Deep Dive Into Components (10-15 minutes)

- **Select critical components** to explore further
- **Address potential bottlenecks**
- **Explain technology choices**
- **Consider tradeoffs** between different approaches

### 4. Scaling & Optimization (5-10 minutes)

- **Identify scaling challenges**
- **Apply relevant patterns** (sharding, replication, caching)
- **Address edge cases** and potential failures
- **Consider performance optimizations**

### 5. Wrap-Up (2-3 minutes)

- **Summarize your design**
- **Acknowledge limitations**
- **Suggest future improvements**
- **Demonstrate understanding of evolution path**

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Starting too detailed** - Begin broad, then narrow
- **Jumping to solutions** without understanding requirements
- **Focusing solely on one aspect** (like just the database)
- **Not considering scale** from the beginning
- **Silent thinking** without communicating your process

## Practice Example: URL Shortener

Let's apply our framework to design a URL shortening service like bit.ly:

### 1. Requirements
- Create short URLs from long ones
- Redirect users to original URL when short URL is accessed
- Scale to millions of URLs
- Fast response times

### 2. High-Level Design
- Web servers to handle URL creation and redirection
- Database to store URL mappings
- Hashing service to generate short codes

### 3. Deep Dive
- URL encoding algorithm (Base62 vs. MD5+Base62)
- Database schema and indexing strategy
- Caching layer for popular URLs

### 4. Scaling
- Read-heavy workload â†’ Caching and read replicas
- Database sharding based on short code
- CDN for global availability

### 5. Wrap-Up
- System handles millions of URLs with sub-100ms response time
- Future improvements: Analytics, custom URLs, expiration policies

## Over to You

Think about a recent app you've used. How would you design its backend system? What questions would you ask first? What components would be in your high-level design?
