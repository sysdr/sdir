# Zero-Downtime Deployment Demo

This demo showcases three critical deployment strategies for distributed systems:

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start all deployment demonstrations
./run_demo.sh start

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```

## 📋 What's Included

### Deployment Strategies

1. **Rolling Deployment** (Port 8080)
   - Gradually replaces instances
   - Minimal resource usage
   - Medium risk

2. **Blue-Green Deployment** (Port 8081)
   - Instant environment switching
   - Double resource usage
   - High safety

3. **Canary Deployment** (Port 8082)
   - Progressive traffic routing
   - Risk mitigation through gradual exposure
   - Smart rollback capabilities

### Features

- 🎛️ **Interactive Dashboard** - Control and monitor all deployments
- 📊 **Real-time Metrics** - Track performance and health
- 🧪 **Automated Testing** - Comprehensive test suite
- 🐳 **Docker-based** - Consistent environment across platforms
- 📝 **Detailed Logging** - Observe deployment behavior

## 🔧 Usage

### Start Specific Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy_control.sh start rolling
./scripts/deploy_control.sh start blue-green
./scripts/deploy_control.sh start canary
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Test all strategies
./scripts/test_deployments.sh all

# Test specific strategy
./scripts/test_deployments.sh rolling

# Load test
./scripts/test_deployments.sh load http://localhost:8080 10 60
```

### Monitor Status
```bash
./scripts/deploy_control.sh status
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this demo, you'll understand:

- ✅ How different deployment strategies handle traffic switching
- ✅ Resource requirements and trade-offs for each approach
- ✅ State management during deployments
- ✅ Health checking and rollback mechanisms
- ✅ Load balancer configuration for zero-downtime updates

## 🔍 Key Insights

### Rolling Deployment
- **Best for**: Regular updates with backward compatibility
- **Consideration**: Mixed version state during deployment
- **Rollback**: Gradual, requires version compatibility

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Best for**: Major updates requiring instant switching
- **Consideration**: Double infrastructure cost
- **Rollback**: Instant, perfect safety

### Canary Deployment
- **Best for**: Risk-averse organizations testing new features
- **Consideration**: Complex traffic routing logic
- **Rollback**: Fast, data-driven decisions

## 🧪 Experiments to Try

1. **Traffic Pattern Analysis**
   - Monitor which instances serve requests during rolling updates
   - Observe instant switching in blue-green deployments
   - Track canary traffic distribution

2. **Failure Scenarios**
   - Stop instances during deployment
   - Simulate network partitions
   - Test database connectivity issues

3. **Performance Comparison**
   - Measure response times during each deployment type
   - Compare resource utilization
   - Analyze error rates

## 🛠️ Customization

### Add New Application Version
1. Copy existing version: `cp -r app/v2 app/v4`
2. Modify features and styling
3. Update Docker configurations
4. Rebuild images: `./run_demo.sh build`

### Modify Traffic Routing
1. Edit nginx configurations in `nginx/configs/`
2. Adjust traffic percentages for canary deployment
3. Add custom headers or routing rules

### Extend Monitoring
1. Add custom metrics to dashboard
2. Integrate with external monitoring tools
3. Implement alerting based on error rates

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker info

# View service logs
cd docker/rolling && docker-compose logs

# Restart everything
./run_demo.sh restart
```

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check port usage
netstat -an | grep LISTEN

# Modify ports in docker-compose.yml files
# Update corresponding documentation
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Reduce concurrent connections
# Check available memory and CPU
```
